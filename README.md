# Final Group Project: Grow Grub!

The final group project, worked on it over a week in a small team.
Plan was to build a garden planner to help keep track of your plants, watering, weeding, plant dates, harvest dates etc.
Completed a basic MVP.

## Skills

Setup auth0, database and some of the key backend points early on.
Dabbled with some new React libraries we hadn't tried before.
Used Gemini to help source plant data when users wanted to grow a plant we didn't have in the database.
Lots of merge conflicts to work through.
